00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.300
Well, I think I've always
had a passion for writing.

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.080
It's just that I never thought
I'd ever write a book.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.240
So the high school that my husband attended and
graduated from, I went there for a few

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.870
years before integration was
named Aracoma High School.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.600
And every year we still
have an annual reunion.

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.770
And at this particular time, the reunion was
held in Columbus, Ohio and us girls, quote

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.730
unquote, we're reminiscing about
our days in school.

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.520
And one of them, we were making fun of some
things that we had known that the grown folks

9
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.030
didn't think we knew. So she spoke up, saying,
you know, somebody ought to write a book.

10
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.460
I said, I'm gonna do that.

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.740
So when we came back home,
I decided that I try.

12
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.100
And I just did from there.

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.260
But I've always liked to write.

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.500
My first book is titled: Faces Behind the
Dust and the dust is the coal dust.

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.150
And it is the story of a
coal miner's daughter on the black side.

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.090
This little nosey five and a half year old
girl running the hollers Crystal Block or her

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.290
little community and she thinks she's got
the skinny on eavesdropping, so she tells

18
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.420
everybody's business in this book.

19
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.500
And it's been quite a joy writing that book
and the response that I've had from it.
