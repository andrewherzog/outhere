00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.270
Well I think I've always had a passion for
writing is jets that I never thought I'd ever

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.790
write a book. So the high school that my
husband attended and graduated from I went there

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.870
for a few years before integration
was named Aracoma high school.

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.600
And every year we still
have an annual reunion.

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.770
And at this particular time the reunion was held
in Columbus Ohio and us good roles quote

6
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.730
unquote were reminiscing about
our days in school.

7
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.520
And one of them we were making fun of some
things that we had known that the grown folks

8
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.000
didn't think we knew. So she spoke them saying
you know somebody ought to write a book.

9
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.460
I said I'm gonna do that.

10
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.100
So when we came back home I decided that
I try and I just do it from there.

11
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.570
But I've always liked to write my first book
is titled Faces Behind the dust and the dust

12
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.120
is the coldest. And it is the story of
a coal miner's daughter on the black side.

13
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.280
This little nosy five and a half year old
girl running the hollows of Crystal block or

14
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.740
her little community.

15
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.830
And she thinks she's got
the skinny on eavesdropping.

16
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.180
So she tells everybody's business in this book and
it's been quite a joke they write in

17
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.480
that book and the response
that I've had from it.
