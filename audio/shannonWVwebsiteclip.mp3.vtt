00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.710
Feeling emotion for the first time and not
numbing it with anything is an experience that

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.520
I'll never forget. Just don't want to say it's
scary, but it kind of is, you know,

3
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.440
feeling yourself again.

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.120
Finding who you are again.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.700
But after you find it, it's it's great.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.710
I think I got lost.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.060
That's how I explain it.

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.480
Being in a box and just walking around.

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.590
Not doing anything.

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.150
Just being stuck somewhere and not
being able to get out.

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.340
Not being able to communicate.

12
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.010
Be a mother. Be a friend or be anything.

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.030
You're just stuck.

14
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.890
And that's what it felt like.

15
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.330
But time's still going.

16
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.650
That never stops.

17
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.830
So the world was going on
and I was stuck in time.

18
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.580
It's what it felt like. Even being
13, I wanted to feel everything.

19
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.890
And I like feeling things
that made me feel good.

20
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.020
And that was bad.

21
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.690
Even at 13, because drugs made me feel good.

22
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.080
They made me feel invincible.

23
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.310
They made me feel pretty.

24
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.990
They made me feel wanted.

25
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.270
And I didn't need anybody else.

26
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.350
I just had drugs.

27
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.790
And that was fine because it made
me feel everything that I needed to.

28
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.260
When I had my son and he made me feel
like that because he needed me and he filled that

29
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.030
void and made me want to be
who I knew I could be.

30
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.450
But on drugs, I couldn't be that
because it just had me stuck.
