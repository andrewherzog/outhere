When I was in my twenties I heard
prophecies from indigenous peoples, and I hear the

2
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760
Apaches talk about things that are coming, and I'd
like to share that one. People who ask

3
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
us is that, it's just some hard times coming
for the people because Mother Earth is going

4
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780
to cleanse herself because there's too many
people on the planet. Some of the

5
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790
technologies are being abused. You know, our people,
the Wars, you know, all this stuff

6
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
that's happening on the planet. I don't know if
you want to call it global warming or

7
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810
whatever, but these hard times are coming. And
I always tell people that I've seen

8
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820
prophecies come true in my lifetime, too, and
I always think that there's some that

9
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830
haven't come true, but if I've seen these
ones come true, why am I questioning whether

10
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840
these other ones are going
to come true or not.
