00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:07.440
When I was in my 20s, I heard prophecies
from indigenous peoples and I hear the Apaches

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.240
talk about things that are coming, and
I'd like to share that one.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.280
People who ask us is that, it's just some
hard times coming for the people because Mother

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.590
Earth is going to cleanse herself because
there's too many people on the planet.

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.050
Some of the technologies are being abused.

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.180
You know, our people, the Wars, you know,
all this stuff that's happening on the planet.

7
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.580
I don't know if you want to
call it global warming or whatever.

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.980
But these hard times are coming.

9
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.170
And I always tell people that I've seen prophecies
come true in my lifetime, too, and I

10
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.600
always think that there's some that haven't come
true, but if I've seen these ones come

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.020
true, why am I questioning whether these other
ones are going to come true or not?
