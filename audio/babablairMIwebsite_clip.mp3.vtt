00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.000
I was imprisoned in this state, and when I
first went to prison, I was twenty four.

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:14.760
Twenty five. And the man who met, the Panthers
who I met, the warriors who I met, the

3
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.630
street legends that I met, the monsters
of fucking Michigan who I met.

4
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.290
I met my best friend ever, you know.

5
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.260
And then many of us over in that span of
time, you know, I watched us struggle and die.

6
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.100
and I stayed because of a sister.

7
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.490
I met my Queen on Woodward.

8
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:46.000
Downtown, think she had just returned from
think she said, Germany or something.

9
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.900
And these thousands of people in Detroit, the
person who draws my, just captures my

10
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.150
attention is a Black Panther.
