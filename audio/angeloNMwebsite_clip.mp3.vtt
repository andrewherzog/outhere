00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970
Did you know that only 2% of our
nation is involved in agricultural production for

2
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980
everything we eat? And of that 2% of people, only
two tenths of a percent of that 2% is

3
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
responsible for the actual production and growing
of that food and the people who

4
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000
actually touch the food. That whole 2% is
all the grocery stores, the bagger boys, the

5
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010
truck drivers, everybody who's involved in the
transport and processing of that food. If

6
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
you think about it, if anything ever
happened to our agriculturally productive land,

7
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030
prices of our food is going to skyrocket.
I'm very skeptical of our country's food system

8
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040
right now, and that's why I love to grow
and, you know, provide as much food, on our

9
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050
local lands as we can. You know, like
any way you can offset supporting this super

10
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060
fragile system I think is a good way to
do because guess what man, that's also a life

11
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070
skill. So when this food system inevitably does crash
, if you know how to grow some food

12
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080
or plant some seed or have you've touched a
soil and grown something to nurture it so

13
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090
that way and turn it nurtures you, then you
have that skill that you can carry on forever

14
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100
and you can show other people and you don't
have to be dependent on a food system that's

15
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
so fragile.
