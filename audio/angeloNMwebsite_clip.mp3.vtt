00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.720
Did you know that only two percent of
our nation is involved in agricultural production

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.860
for everything we eat?

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.900
And of that, two percent of people.

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.990
Only two tenths of a percent of that
two percent is responsible for the actual production

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.610
and growing of that food.

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.650
And the people who actually touch the food.

7
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.060
That whole two percent is all the grocery
stores, the bagger boys, the truck drivers,

8
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.780
everybody who's involved in the transport
and processing of that food.

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.790
If you think about it, if anything
ever happened to our agriculturally productive land,

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.590
prices of our food is going to skyrocket.

11
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.900
I'm very skeptical of our country's food system right
now, and that's why I love to grow.

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.890
And, you know, provide as much food
on our local lands as we can.

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.530
You know, like any way you can offset supporting
this super fragile system I think is a

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.920
good way to do because guess what?

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.750
Man, that's also a life skill.

16
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.810
So when this food system inevitably does crash, if
you know how to grow some food or

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.620
plant some seed or if you've touched the soil
and grown something to nurture it so that

18
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.030
we in turn it nurtures you, then you have
that skill that you can carry on forever and

19
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.960
you can show other people and you'll have to
be dependent on a food system that's so

20
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.440
fragile.
