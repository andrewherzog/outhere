00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.270
America for me is like missing out on how good
it feels to be there for other people, to

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.090
have genuine conversations with people, to
like not deflect a lot.

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.430
Yeah, because I do it every day.

4
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.290
Say, Hey, how are you? Oh I'm good.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.820
I'm not good.

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.770
I'm a black trans woman in America.

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.640
I'm not good. I'm not
happy, or whatever it is.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.070
It's like we don't check on our neighbors.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.400
We overlook how women come up missing.

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.450
We have this sense of entitlement.

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.710
I don't know. It's just so many things like,
I guess that's the thing that is so many

12
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.980
things with America. That's spun maybe out of control
for me, that it's too much shit to

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.060
clean up.

14
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.400
The realms of where my power is
in Detroit, in the black trans community.

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.860
And it's a choice. If you don't do it in
your powers and what's in your region and choose

16
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.470
to do nothing, then you're
adding to the problem.

17
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.570
So for me, whether you like what I'm saying or
not, I'm out here trying to find a good

18
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.950
value.
